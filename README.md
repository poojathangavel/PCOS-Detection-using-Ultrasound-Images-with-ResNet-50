# PCOS-Detection-using-Ultrasound-Images-with-ResNet-50
This project detects PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) from ultrasound images using deep learning. I used ResNet-50 as the main model, compared it with AlexNet and SVM, and performed EDA using Python libraries like OpenCV and Matplotlib. The model was trained, evaluated, and predictions were made using the Gemini API.
